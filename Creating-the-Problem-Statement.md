# Problem Statement Creation

## Background
Provide context or background information about the problem. Explain why this problem is important to address. Include any relevant historical data or trends.

### Example:
"The retail industry has experienced a significant shift towards e-commerce, resulting in an increasing volume of online transactions. As a leading e-commerce platform, Company X has seen a steady increase in customer complaints about delayed deliveries, impacting customer satisfaction and loyalty."

## Objective
Clearly define the main objective of the analysis. What are you trying to achieve or uncover through your analysis?

### Example:
"The objective of this analysis is to identify the key factors contributing to delivery delays and to develop actionable insights to reduce these delays, thereby improving customer satisfaction and retention."

## Research Questions
List the specific research questions that your analysis will address. These questions should guide your data analysis process.

### Example:
- What are the primary causes of delivery delays?
- Are there specific regions or time periods with higher instances of delays?
- How do delivery delays correlate with other variables such as order size, distance, or time of purchase?

## Data Description
Provide a brief description of the data that will be used in the analysis. Mention the source, type of data, and any relevant attributes.

### Example:
"The dataset includes delivery records from January 2020 to December 2023, sourced from the companyâ€™s logistics database. Key attributes include order ID, customer ID, delivery time, distance, order size, and delivery status."

## Methodology
Outline the methodology or approach that will be used to analyze the data. Mention any specific tools, techniques, or models that will be applied.

### Example:
"The analysis will involve data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling. Python, along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, will be used for data manipulation and visualization. Regression analysis and machine learning models will be employed to identify significant predictors of delivery delays."

## Expected Outcomes
Describe the expected outcomes or the potential impact of the analysis. How will the findings be used to address the problem?

### Example:
"We expect to identify the key factors leading to delivery delays and to develop predictive models to forecast potential delays. The insights gained from this analysis will be used to optimize delivery routes, improve logistics planning, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction."
