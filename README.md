## Data Analytics Capstone Projects

### Coffee Chain Sales Analysis (CoffeeChainSalesV2)

In this capstone project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data to determine the optimal market for launching a new product within a coffee chain. Leveraging my skills in data analysis and visualization, I explored various market dynamics and customer preferences to identify key insights. Utilizing tools such as Excel, Python, Pandas, and Tableau, I gained valuable insights into market trends and consumer behavior. This project was not only a valuable learning experience but also an enjoyable journey into the world of data-driven decision-making.

### Hotel Booking - Online Cancellations Analysis

For this capstone project, I delved into the analysis of hotel booking data to understand patterns and factors influencing online cancellations. Utilizing Python for data cleaning and analysis, I employed Excel to develop a comprehensive framework for dashboards and calculations. The final presentation, crafted using Tableau, included insightful visualizations and dashboards to convey findings effectively. It was an enriching experience that allowed me to apply my analytical skills and creativity to solve real-world challenges.


### Video Games Dataset - Interactive Dashboard

In my video game data analysis project, I applied the skills I learned in Springboard, emphasizing the importance of continuous growth and learning. My first step was to understand the data thoroughly before diving into analysis. Once I had a clear picture, I cleaned the data and started exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Python library pandas.

Although this dataset is commonly used in beginner projects, I used it as an opportunity to add an interactive element to make my analysis more engaging and level up my skills. This experience not only continues to solidifiy my foundational skills but also allowed me to try out new features and incorporate them into my work.
