### Video Games Dataset - Interactive Dashboard

In my video game data analysis project, I applied skills from my data analytics program to emphasize continuous growth and learning. I began by thoroughly understanding the data, then cleaned it and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and the pandas library.

Despite the dataset being common in beginner projects, I added an interactive element to enhance engagement and improve my skills. This experience solidified my foundational knowledge and allowed me to experiment with new features.

After loading, cleaning, and exploring the data in Python, I saved it as a CSV file for use in Excel. In Excel, I created a wireframe of the final product, added a date column to show timelines, and used a timeline filter to make the dashboard interactive.

When beginning any project, I create a scenario of a client that I would be assisting in a real world situation, see my notes below for writing an efficient problem statement. For this project, I was approached by a small group of post grads that wanted to create the next video game. The problem was, there are so many games out there, so many genres and while the market does seem saturated they were creative and had great ideas. They tasked me with finding out what is selling and the best place to launch. I translated that into "what is the ideal game genre that is compatible with the most popular gaming platform and will perform well in the most sought after regions." 

Step one of creating a problem statement was completed, with a clear picture of the problem and its context, I identified the stakeholders that would be affected by this analytical undertaking. This is important to know from the beginning as it will inform what type of presentation I will give upon the conclusion of my analysis. Since the post grads would be using this analysis to pitch venture capitalists, they were the stakeholders; a unique blend of both executive and technical.

My task did not include criteria venture capitalists would require, nor would I make decisions affecting the direction of their vision. I was there to use data to address their problem and provide insights, through stunning visuals, based on what the data revealed.

The success of this undertaking would be measured by having a clearer idea of which genres are popular, the most used gaming platform, and the most fiscally sound region to launch their game.

After discussing the particulars and concluding our meeting, we had a solid and mutually agreed-upon problem statement. The students provided me with a large data set and said they'd call in a few days.




Writing an Efficient Problem Statement
Define the Problem Clearly:
Summarize the core issue that needs to be addressed, focusing on the impact it has on the client or industry.

Identify Stakeholders:
Mention who is affected by the problem and who stands to benefit from the solution.

Set Boundaries:
Clearly state what is within the scope of the problem and what is not, to avoid ambiguity.

State the Objective:
Define what success looks like and what the analysis aims to achieve.

Use Data:
Support the problem statement with relevant data and statistics to provide evidence of the problemâ€™s significance.
