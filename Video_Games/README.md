### Video Games Dataset - Interactive Dashboard

In my video game data analysis project, I applied the skills I learned in Springboard, emphasizing the importance of continuous growth and learning. My first step was to understand the data thoroughly before diving into analysis. Once I had a clear picture, I cleaned the data and started exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Python library pandas.

Although this dataset is commonly used in beginner projects, I used it as an opportunity to add an interactive element to make my analysis more engaging and level up my skills. This experience not only continues to solidifiy my foundational skills but also allowed me to try out new features and incorporate them into my work.
